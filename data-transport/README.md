>Data transport (data transmission, also data communication or digital communications) is the transfer of data (a digital bitstream or a digitized analog signal) over a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint communication channel. 

--- from Wikipedia

To transer the data, a communication channel must be established betwenn the "Connected device" and a "Cloud Backend".

We will use examples of data transport technologies to find out:

* how to established a communication channel between two communication partners?
* how the sensors values can be transfered to the backend?
* how transfer protocols of the internet can be used to simplify the transfer?
* how these transfer protocols differs?
