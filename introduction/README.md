## MicroPython

> MicroPython is a lean and efficient implementation of the Python 3 programming language that includes a small subset of the Python standard library and is optimised to run on microcontrollers and in constrained environments.

### Developing with MicroPython

Check the following points:

- Use the **MU-Editor** which can be downloaded from https://codewith.mu/

    Note for Mac Users with Catalina OSX:  
    Start the application for the first time with CTRL Key pressed to be able to accept the security restrictions be the macos. Use version Mu 1.1.0.alpha.2

-  Use a Python3 **Virtual Environment**

    You need full Python on your host machine to be able to run the `esptool` which is needed to bridge the gap between the host machine and the microcontroller.

    Check if `virtualenv` is installed

    ```
    $  which virtualenv/usr/local/bin/virtualenv
    ```

    If no installation can be found, install it using pip:

    ```
    $ pip install virtualenv
    ```

    Use it now to setup a Python3 Virtual Environment:

    ```
    $ virtualenv -p python3 env
    $ source env/bin/activate
    (env) $ python -V
    Python 3.7.6
    (env) $ deactivate
    ```
