### Installation on Microcontroller Boards

Here you will information how to install/use MicroPython on the two boards: [ESP8622](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3213) and [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/). The installation and the setup differs completely, due to the different architectures of the two microcontrollers. While the ESP8266 relies on a computer running Windows, OS X or Linux to obtain programming code, the Raspberry Pi is a separate, small computer usally connected to a monitor via HDMI and controlled by a USB mouse and keyboard. But, if using a Raspberry Pi as embedded controller, a `ssh` connection is usally the preferred way to go.
